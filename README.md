# Real-Time Chat App
Creating a simple real-time chat app using Python sockets and Tkinter involves building a server and a client, and then connecting them through a network. 

First, create two separate files for the server (`server.py`) and the client (`client.py`).

## Server Socket
1. Create server configuration. Add the host IP Address and port number.
```python
HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 1100
```
